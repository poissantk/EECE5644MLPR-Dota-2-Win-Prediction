# EECE5644MLPR-Dota-2-Win-Prediction

Dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dota2+Games+Results

Worked with a sparse dataset to try to predict which of the two teams would win based off of the characters selected. Multiple models were created in order to compare the results of each.

Achieved about 61% accuracy in predicting the winner when using linear discriminant analysis. This showed that the characters selected do have an impact on the game, but ultimately most of it comes down to skill.
